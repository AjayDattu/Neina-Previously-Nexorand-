# Frontend Leaderboard Application

This project is a responsive frontend application built with **Next.js**, **Redux**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It provides an interactive interface for users to register, log in, view and update points for friends, and see a dynamically updating leaderboard.

## Features

1. **Registration Page** - Allows users to register by entering their username, email, and password.
2. **Login Page** - Authenticates users and grants access to the Home and Leaderboard pages.
3. **Home Page** - Displays a list of friends, each with a point count. Users can click on a friend's name to increase their points, which updates the leaderboard dynamically.
4. **Leaderboard Page** - Ranks all users by points in descending order and shows point history when a user name is clicked.
